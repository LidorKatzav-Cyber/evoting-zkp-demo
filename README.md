# E-Voting + Zero-Knowledge Proof (Graph Isomorphism) – PoC

Educational Proof-of-Concept that demonstrates how **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** can be integrated into an **e-voting system**.  

The system uses a **graph isomorphism ZKP** as an authentication gate:  
- Only after a successful proof the user can cast a vote.  
- Votes are encrypted with **AES-GCM** and stored securely.  
- Encrypted logs allow post-election verification without exposing ballot contents.
